Welcome to Hermes1D
===================

**NOTE**: The development of Hermes1D stopped in July 2011. From now on, 
1D problems are solved using Hermes2D. This makes it possible to use
advanced object-oriented structure of weak forms of Hermes2D, multimesh 
assembling, dynamical meshes for time-dependent problems, and other things 
that we were unable to reimplement in Hermes1D due to our limited manpower.
